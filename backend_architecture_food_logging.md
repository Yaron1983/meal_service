## 3.1 Meal Logging Flowchart

Below is a flowchart describing the process of logging a meal, from the mobile app through authentication to saving the meal in the database:

## 4. Technology Stack & Rationale

### 4.1 Backend Framework: **Django + Django REST Framework**
- **Why Django?**
  - Mature, robust, and secure web framework.
  - Built-in admin interface for easy data management.
  - Excellent support for relational databases and ORM.
  - Django REST Framework (DRF) makes building RESTful APIs straightforward and well-documented.
- **Why Microservices?**
  - Each core feature (e.g., authentication, meal logging) is developed and deployed as an independent service.
  - Improves scalability, maintainability, and allows independent development and deployment.
  - Each service can have its own database, reducing coupling and improving data security.

### 4.2 Database: **PostgreSQL**
- **Why PostgreSQL?**
  - Powerful, open-source relational database.
  - Excellent support for complex queries and data integrity.
  - Scalable and reliable for both small and large-scale applications.
  - Well-supported by Django ORM.

### 4.3 API Gateway
- **Role:**  
  - Central entry point for all client requests.
  - Routes requests to the appropriate microservice (e.g., authentication, meals).
  - Handles cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
- **Possible Technologies:**  
  - Kong, NGINX, or AWS API Gateway.

### 4.4 Authentication & OTP
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):**  
  - Used for stateless, secure authentication between client and backend.
- **External SMS/OTP Provider:**  
  - Services like Twilio, Vonage, or a local provider for sending OTP codes to users.

### 4.5 Containerization & Deployment
- **Docker:**  
  - Each microservice runs in its own container for isolation and easy deployment.
- **Orchestration:**  
  - Kubernetes or Docker Compose for managing multiple services.
- **Cloud Hosting:**  
  - AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalable, managed infrastructure.

### 4.6 API Documentation
- **OpenAPI/Swagger:**  
  - Auto-generated documentation for all REST endpoints, making it easy for frontend and QA teams to understand and test the API.

## 5. Design Rationale

- **Django** was chosen for its reliability, security features, and rapid development capabilities, especially when combined with Django REST Framework for API creation.
- **Microservices architecture** allows each feature to scale independently, simplifies codebases, and enables teams to work in parallel.
- **PostgreSQL** is a robust, production-grade database that integrates seamlessly with Django and supports complex data relationships.
- **API Gateway** centralizes request management, improving security and maintainability.
- **JWT** provides secure, stateless authentication, ideal for mobile applications.
- **Docker** and orchestration tools ensure the system is portable, scalable, and easy to deploy in any environment.
