## 2. API List (OpenAPI Style)

> **Note:** Starting from this implementation, each meal item (meal_item) references the food catalog using food_id. You may send custom nutritional values (override), but by default, values are calculated automatically based on the catalog.

### 2.1 Login
- **POST /api/auth/login**
  - **Request Body:**  
    ```json
    { "phone_number": "string" }
    ```

    ```json
    { "otp_sent": true }
    ```

### 2.2 OTP Verification
- **POST /api/auth/verify**
  - **Request Body:**  
    ```json
    { "phone_number": "string", "otp": "string" }
    ```
  - **Response:**  
    ```json
    { "token": "string" }
    ```

### 2.3 Create New Meal
- **POST /api/meals**
  - **Header:** Authorization: Bearer {token}
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "meal_time": "datetime",

    }
    ```
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    { "meal_id": 101 }

  - **Header:** Authorization: Bearer {token}
  - **Query Parameters:**  
    - from_date (optional)
    - to_date (optional)

  - **Response:**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 12,
        "name": "Chicken Breast",
        "calories": 130,
        "protein": 22,
        "carbs": 0,
        "fat": 3,
        "fiber": 0,
        "sugar": 0,
        "sodium": 50
      }
    ]
    ```
- **POST /api/foods** (admin only)
  - **Description:** Add a new food to the catalog
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Chicken Breast",
      "calories": 130,
      "protein": 22,
      "carbs": 0,
      "fat": 3,
      "fiber": 0,
      "sugar": 0,
      "sodium": 50
    }
    ```
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    { "food_id": 12 }
    ```

## 2.x Example: Automatic Nutritional Value Calculation
> For example, if you select food_id=12 (Chicken Breast, 130 calories per 100g) and send quantity=150, the system will return:
> calories = 130 * 1.5 = 195
> protein = 22 * 1.5 = 33
> and so on.

## 4. Technology Stack & Rationale

### 4.1 Backend Framework: **Django + Django REST Framework**
- **Why Django?**
  - Mature, robust, and secure web framework.
  - Built-in admin interface for easy data management.
  - Excellent support for relational databases and ORM.
  - Django REST Framework (DRF) makes building RESTful APIs straightforward and well-documented.
- **Why Microservices?**
  - Each core feature (e.g., authentication, meal logging) is developed and deployed as an independent service.
  - Improves scalability, maintainability, and allows independent development and deployment.
  - Each service can have its own database, reducing coupling and improving data security.

### 4.2 Database: **PostgreSQL**
- **Why PostgreSQL?**
  - Powerful, open-source relational database.
  - Excellent support for complex queries and data integrity.
  - Scalable and reliable for both small and large-scale applications.
  - Well-supported by Django ORM.

### 4.3 API Gateway
- **Role:**  
  - Central entry point for all client requests.
  - Routes requests to the appropriate microservice (e.g., authentication, meals).
  - Handles cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
- **Possible Technologies:**  
  - NGINX or AWS API Gateway.

### 4.4 Authentication & OTP
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):**  
  - Used for stateless, secure authentication between client and backend.

### 4.5 Containerization & Deployment
- **Docker:**  
  - Each microservice runs in its own container for isolation and easy deployment.
- **Orchestration:**  
  - Kubernetes or Docker Compose for managing multiple services.
- **Cloud Hosting:**  
  - AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalable, managed infrastructure.

### 4.6 API Documentation
- **OpenAPI/Swagger:**  
  - Auto-generated documentation for all REST endpoints, making it easy for frontend and QA teams to understand and test the API.

---

## 5. Design Rationale

- **Django** was chosen for its reliability, security features, and rapid development capabilities, especially when combined with Django REST Framework for API creation.
- **Microservices architecture** allows each feature to scale independently, simplifies codebases, and enables teams to work in parallel.
- **PostgreSQL** is a robust, production-grade database that integrates seamlessly with Django and supports complex data relationships.
- **API Gateway** centralizes request management, improving security and maintainability.
- **JWT** provides secure, stateless authentication, ideal for mobile applications.
- **Docker** and orchestration tools ensure the system is portable, scalable, and easy to deploy in any environment.
- **Food catalog** enables consistent, accurate nutritional tracking and supports future extensibility (e.g., adding more nutrients, food search, etc).

---

## 6. API Documentation

- All REST endpoints are documented using OpenAPI (Swagger), providing clear, interactive documentation for developers and testers.
- Example requests and responses are included for each endpoint.
- The documentation is auto-generated and kept up-to-date with the codebase, ensuring accuracy and ease of use.
